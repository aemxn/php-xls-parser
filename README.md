This shit reads `Data-convert.xls` and manipulate its sheets and stuff into a String that I can use to create queries to database. Scripting made easy!

Original code from:
https://code.google.com/p/php-excel-reader/

This PHP library expands on the great work done in the PHP Excel Reader project on SourceForge.

It reads the binary format of XLS files directly and can return values and formats from any cell.
